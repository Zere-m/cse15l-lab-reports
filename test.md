* The working directory was home at first when the command was run, later it was changed to lecture 1 (on line 2)
* Running the cd command with no argument meant returning/ staying in the home directory
* Running the cd command with the absolute path to the lecture1 folder changed the directory to it because it was within the filesystem
* Running the cd command with the absolute path to the en-us.txt file gave an error because it is not a directory

* The working directory was home throughout the commands
* Running the command with no arguments meant listing the contents of the current directory which was home
* Runing the command with a path to a directory listed the contents of that directory
* Running the command with a path to a file listed/ returned the path itself
